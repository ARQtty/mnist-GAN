# mnist-GAN
Tensorflow implementation of Generative Adversarial Network for MNIST dataset

# GAN
An unsupervised ml algorithm which tries to produce the same data as it's input. Based on minimax game of two nn agents: discriminative (estimator) and generative (creator) 

# Result

9 random samples of generative network's part
